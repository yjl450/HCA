        During the Qin and Han dynasties, records of the Chinese phoenix gradually became more numerous. In the descriptions in the "Book of Han", "Book of Later Han" and other works, one thing the phoenix emperor has in common is its strange size, which can reach a height of five or six feet or even more than ten feet. This gives a new character to the phoenix motifs of the Qin and Han dynasties. These phoenixes are generally generous in shape, with chest outstretched wings, high vision, and imposing. In particular, the phoenix pattern of the Han Dynasty fully reveals the dynamics and momentum of the image, showing everywhere the overall sense of capacity, linear speed, and the power of change. Because the phoenix is a sacred bird, people believe that the phoenix can bring good luck and auspicious signs, thus, the phoenix pattern has an extremely important position on the decorations. In addition, it is recorded in the Gleanings that the phoenix and the Chongming bird have similar functions, so the phoenix pattern is also often found in the decoration of the tomb doors of Han Dynasty tombs, where it is believed that the phoenix can dispel demons and ghosts. In han dynasty, Xiangru Sima wroted that “Feng is travelling aournd the world to find his Huang” in poem Feng qiu Huang.《凤求凰》司马相如：“凤兮凤兮归故乡，遨游四海求其凰”. So we infer at that time, Feng and Huang is still representing different genders.        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
