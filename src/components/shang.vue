        During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, records about Chinese phoenix already appeared in ancient books. For example, in "Shang Shu - Yu Shu - Yi Ji 5th"《尚书·虞书·益稷第五》, after Dayu controlling the flood, a celebration ceremony was held in which birds and animals sang and danced, and the phoenix also came. But the word Fenghuang appears here is not yet the phoenix we refer to now, but the Feng Emperor. At that time, the phoenix was regarded as a sacred bird and had a royal status among birds. In addition to written records, a piece of oracle bone was unearthed at Yinxu, and the oracle bone recounts the story of the Shang king who ordered his ministers to catch the phoenix. Therefore, the engraving of the phoenix on jade and bronze vessels is a striking expression of the ruler's idea of "heaven's mandate". In terms of the artistic characters, most phoenixes were in the shape of flower crowns, with plump wings and long tail feathers, and wide, powerful claws, showing a brave and robust attitude, while also reflecting the mystification of birds and artistic exaggeration.
