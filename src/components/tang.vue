        Phoenix culture was developed well in the Tang Dynasty, and there was a phoenix fever, which was mainly manifested in using phoenix as a metaphor for people, phoenix as decoration, phoenix as a beautiful name for things, and phoenix as a metaphor for marriage and love. For example, the word Feng appears 2978 times, the word Huang 282 times, and the word luan 1080 times in the "All Tang Poems", and the total number of these three most representative titles of phoenix accounts for about one-tenth of the total number of entries in the "All Tang Poems", with an average of about one "phoenix" or "phoenix" or "luan" in every ten Tang poems. Before the Tang Dynasty, people did not easily use phoenixes as a metaphor for people, and occasionally only kings, sages, or people who were superb, and very few women were metaphorized as phoenixes. However, in the Tang Dynasty, the metaphor of phoenix was used freely and liberally, which reflects that the usage of phoenix gradually shifted from the ruling class to other social classes. Under the influence of this social trend, there were many different kinds of phoenix patterns in the Tang Dynasty, and the shapes became more bird-like. Many of the phoenix motifs are full of joyful songs and dances, reflecting the material and cultural life of the glorious Tang Dynasty

        <h2>Tricolor Chinese Phoenix Head Pot, Tang Dynasty, the Palace Museum </h2>
        The mouth of the pot is phoenix-head shaped, with a thin neck, a flat rounded belly, a high flared foot, and a flat foot. The entire body is glazed with green, brown and white, and the foot is unglazed. A curved handle is placed on one side. The phoenix-headed pot became popular in the early Tang Dynasty, and is a common form in Tang Sancai pottery. It has the same style of Persian Sassanid wares as another common pot with double dragon handles from the same period. This decorative technique, which cleverly combines foreign culture with traditional national art, is an innovation in the shape of Tang Sancai.

        <h2>A Gilt Silver Plate with Phoenix Design, Tang Dynasty, Shaanxi History Museum </h2>
        The phoenix bird is skillfully executed, showing the property of Tang Dynasty . The choice of this tail-curving, sideways-returning posture makes the phoenix bird's body form a cohesive force toward the center, rich in overall strength, and thus also endowed with a sense of motion. If water is placed in liquid form, the bird comes to life with the water waves, as if it is about to fly and wants to fly, making it more vital and aesthetically interesting.
