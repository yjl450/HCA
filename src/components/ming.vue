        The phoenixes of the Ming and Qing dynasties formed a specific shape and standardized style and were widely used in all levels of society, including royal costumes and jewelry, and folk crafts and decorations. On the basis of summarizing and integrating the characteristics of the phoenix pattern through the ages, people summarized a set of recipes and patterns for painting phoenixes, such as "a phoenix has three lengths: long eyes, long legs, and long tail". At the same time, the phoenix pattern in the Ming and Qing dynasties also likes to combine with other patterns, such as cloud phoenix, group phoenix, and flower phoenix, which infused the pattern with auspicious symbolic meaning and express people's good wishes.
        In Ming and Qing dynasty, we are able to see from the poems that Fenghuang is totally representing women. In Summer writing by Shulan Chen, a women poet, she wrote that she is willing to become a fenghuang for husband is said to be Wutong tree.《夏日书帐》：陈淑兰 帘幕风微日正长，庭前一片芰荷香。人传郎在梧桐树，妾愿将身化凤凰。”
