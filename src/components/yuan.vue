        During the Yuan Dynasty, the decoration of porcelain matured and colored porcelain gradually became the mainstream of Chinese porcelain. The decoration of phoenixes changed from engraving and printing to brush painting, and a large number of beautiful and colorful phoenixes appeared on porcelain, rich in artistry. In addition to the gentleness and elegance of the Song Dynasty, the phoenix pattern presented a rough and vigorous, free and unrestrained style, which exactly reflected the nomadic and unrestrained attitude and concept of life and the robust and vigorous spirit of this era.
        In Yuan Dynasty, the poems also follow the zeitgeist of war and fighting. For example, Fang Hui wrote that “Heaven and earth do not stop fighting tiger, the world dare to look at Phoenix.” 《重游凤凰台》“天地未休貔虎战，江山敢望凤凰来”

        <h2>Yuan blue and White Phoenix Head Flattened Pot, Yuan Dynasty, the Palace Museum </h2>
        The phoenix body is painted on the upper part of the round body with its wings hanging down to the sides, while the lower part of the pot is decorated with peonies in full bloom, presenting an interesting scene of a phoenix bird flying among the peonies. This pot also uses rough lines, showing the Mongo’s artistic taste.
