        During the Wei, Jin, Southern, and Northern Dynasties, there were frequent regime changes, the cultures of various ethnic groups were greatly integrated, and Buddhism began to be introduced into the Central Plains. The expression of the phoenix also changed. The Buddhist-influenced acanthus designs and lotus patterns were fused with the phoenix pattern, giving it a new symbolic meaning - reincarnation. In terms of art, the shape of the phoenix basically continues the image characteristics of the Han Dynasty phoenix pattern, on the basis of the integration of floral patterns, the phoenix is mostly adopted in the fresh floral patterns of the image of flying wings, appearing extraordinarily elegant and free, light and delicate.
